# Basmatinet

Welcome to this project folks !

Whether you like it or not this project is all about riiiiice or riz in french. It is also about Deep Learning and MLOPS. So if you want to learn to train and deploy a simple model to recognize rice type basing on a photo, then you are at the right place.

## 0- Project's Roadmap

This project will consist to:

- [x] Train a Deep Learning model with Pytorch.
- [x] Transfert learning from Efficient Net.
- [x] Data augmentation with Albumentation.
- [x] Save trained model with early stopping.
- [x] Track the training with MLFLOW.
- [x] Serve the model with a Rest Api built with Flask.
- [x] Encrypt data client side before sending to the api server to allow confidentiality.
- [x] Package the application in microservice's fashion with Docker.
- [x] Yaml for configurations file.
- [x] Passing arguments anywhere it is possible.
- [x] Orchestration the prediction service with Kubernetes (k8S) on Google Cloud Platform.
- [ ] Logging during training.
- [ ] CI/CD.
- [ ] Save images and predictions in InfluxDB database.
- [ ] Unitary tests with Pytest (Fixtures and Mocks).
- [ ] Data Drift monitoring. 
- [ ] Concept Drift monitoring. 
- [ ] Monitoring avec Grafana.

## 1- Install project's dependencies and packages

## 2- Train a basmatinet model

## 3- Dockerize the model and push the Docker Image to Google Container Registry

## 4- Deploy the application on Kubernetes (Google Kubernetes Engine)
